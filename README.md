## About
[Image Classifier](https://arctic-anvil-294604.wn.r.appspot.com/) is a web app created for the purpose of classifying images. Our target audience is art students who are learning how to identify art on their own, or aspiring artists who are curious about what their painting would be classified as. The web app uses trained convolutional neural network models to classify the Style, Artist, and Genre of an art piece. 

Once the models have classified the painting, the app displays the results and the confidence level for each result. In addition, it uses a [Google Custom Search](https://developers.google.com/custom-search/v1/overview) API to find other similar paintings in the same categories.


## Usage
[Click here](https://arctic-anvil-294604.wn.r.appspot.com/instructions) for detailed instructions on how to use the site.


## Hosting
Painting Classifier is currently hosted on the [Google Cloud Platform](https://console.cloud.google.com/appengine/start).


## Models

All of our models are hosted at the
[FA20-CS121-fastai](https://www.github.com/kiphenglim/FA20-CS121-fastai)
repository. You can see our data preparation and training scripts.


## Acknowledgements

We owe a huge thanks to our colleagues in CS121, Professor Z Sweedyk,
and grutor Macy Mills for being immense resources during the
development process.

We also thank the authors of the ICIP2016 paper "Ceci nâ€™est pas une
pipe: A Deep ConvolutionalNetwork for Fine-art Paintings
Classification" for providing the inspiration for this project. In
particular, our gratitude goes to C.S. Chan for providing the
formatted source data for our training, which can be accessed at the
[cs-chan/ArtGAN](https://github.com/cs-chan/ArtGAN) repository.

Finally, we thank the WikiArt team for compiling such a rich database
of visual artworks that can be enjoyed by the public and used by
researchers alike.
