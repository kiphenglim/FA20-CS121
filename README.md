## About
[Image Classifier](https://arctic-anvil-294604.wn.r.appspot.com/) is a web app created for the purpose of classifying images. Our target audience is art students who are learing how to identify art on their own, or aspisring artists who are curius about what their painting would be classified as. The web app uses trained convolutional neural network models to classify the Style, Artist, and Genre of an art piece. 

Once the models have classified the painting, the app displays the results and the confidence level for each result. In addition, it uses a [Google Custom Search](https://developers.google.com/custom-search/v1/overview) API to find other similar paintings in the same categories.
